# VPNM (VPN Manager for Linux)

I wrote this as a tool for my own use — especially since I like setting up fresh Linux distros. This simple utility allows you to quickly import and manage `.ovpn` VPN profiles.

## Features

- Bulk import `.ovpn` files
- Create and manage login profiles
- View, edit, or delete VPNs from a user-friendly interface

## About

This tool is designed for **Linux systems** using `NetworkManager` (`nmcli`) — tested on Linux Mint.
